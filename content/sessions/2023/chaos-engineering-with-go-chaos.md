Go-Chaos is a very powerful open-source chaos engineering tool. What sets it apart from other chaos engineering tools is, its simplicity. One of the challenges with chaos engineering is the steep learning curve of the current tools and software, either for initial setup, day to day usage, as well as on-boarding new services and applications. 
Go-chaos aims to provide a simpler way to perform chaos engineering on any architecture or any complex system, but it also seeks a faster mechanism to develop chaos experiments for multiple services, systems or application
