As developers, we do ensure that we put security into consideration but while doing that, how much data security and privacy of our users do we put into consideration? Are we aware of the users' data rights? how much users' data do we collect? How much of that do we really need? do we really need all the user data we collect? Do we really have a user data recovery plan? Join me in this session as we dissect this topic and answer these questions. Some other talk points include data anonymization, data protection, data storage, and disposal and destruction.
