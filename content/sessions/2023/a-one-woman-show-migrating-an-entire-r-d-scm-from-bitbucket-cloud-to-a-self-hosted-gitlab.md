Writing code is something that we learned. Managing a project E2E - Probably not that much.

In this talk, I’ll share my journey of migrating an entire R&D’s codebase from BitBucket to GitLab on my own - But with the great help of people along the way - Planning, implementation, and handoffs.

I’ll share best practices for managing a technical project with a lot of takeaways you could adopt so your project will be handled smoothly and successfully.
