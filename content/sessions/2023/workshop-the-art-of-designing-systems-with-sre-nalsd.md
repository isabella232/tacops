Designing is the prelude of a good architecture and a good architecture is the art of the possible. By following an iterative style of system design and implementation, Google arrived at robust and scalable designs with low operational costs called Non-Abstract Large System Design (NALSD).
In this workshop I am going to introduce participants to the principles of non-abstract large systems design (NALSD), and provide a hands-on experience applying their principles to the design and evaluation of these systems.
