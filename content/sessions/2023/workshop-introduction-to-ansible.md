Ansible is an open source project that allows to automate the provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes. Under the principle of treating infrastructure as code, it allows the application of best practices like peer reviews, QA testing, version control, as well as bringing transparency to the setup and configuration of hosts. The workshop will cover the basics of Ansible.
