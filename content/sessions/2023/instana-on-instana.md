Instana, an observability platform created in Solingen, is transitioning to a “multi-region” pure Kubernetes model for managing our fleet of compute and data processing infrastructure. This offers us the ability to give our customer-facing sales teams an “30 minuets or less” approach spinning up a new environment which can handle customers with all of the necessary security redundancy and performance needs. During this  session, Hunter Madison, Cloud Architect of Instana will cover how we made this transition and the advantages and pitfalls for teams thinking of making thier own transition.
