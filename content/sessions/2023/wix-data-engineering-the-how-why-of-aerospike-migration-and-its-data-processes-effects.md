In this talk I’ll cover Wix story of migrating from Redis & HBase to Aerospike. I’ll explain why we had to do it, what other solutions we examined and eliminated in the solution selection process, and eventually why we chose Aerospike as our ultimate solution for the Data Engineering major use case, how Aerospike architecture plays a big part of this decision and the amazing results we achieved by performing this migration.
