The practice of Site Reliability Engineering has become a heavily enforced engineering practice for enterprises seeking to accelerate or reengineer their digital transformations with a resilience-first approach. But who are SREs? What do SREs do? How do they differ from other engineers? We will take a deep dive in understanding the foundational principles of site reliability engineering. SREs focuses on the reliability, scalability, availability and resilience throughout the software development lifecycle.
