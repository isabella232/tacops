I'm a senior full-stack developer with a favorite kid named Security.
For over ten years now, I've enjoyed writing clean code, simplifying complex problems, leading feature development, and influencing innovation every day.
When I’m not busy with code, you’ll find me talking about application performance, building confidence in code-bases, product architecture, developing organizational culture.
